      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla and blotted pumpkin until smooth. Set aside. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft. Fold in 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Cover the dough and chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Chilling the dough is imperative for this recipe. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove dough from the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone   baking mats.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Scoop the dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and roll each into balls. Arrange cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Using the back of a spoon or the bottom of a cup/measuring cup, slightly flatten the tops of the dough balls. (Without doing so, the cookies may not spread.) <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set. The cookies will look very soft in the center. Remove from the oven. If you find that your cookies didn’t spread much at all, flatten them out with the back of a spoon when you take them out of the oven. If desired, press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is only for looks. <br>
       <br>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Cool cookies on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. The longer the cookies cool, the even better they taste! The flavor gets stronger and the texture becomes chewier. I usually let them sit, uncovered, for several hours before serving. Chewiness and pumpkin flavor are even stronger on day 2. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. <br>
      </p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p class="notes">
      <strong>Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:</strong> You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature, then continue with step 4. Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw.<br>
      <br>
     <strong>Pumpkin:</strong> Squeeze as much of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree as you can before adding it to the cookie dough. I simply squeeze the puree with paper towels. See photo in the post for a visual. This will help produce a less cakey cookie. Less moisture is a good thing here! Measure 6 Tablespoons AFTER the pumpkin has been squeezed/blotted. Do not use pumpkin pie filling.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>Pumpkin Pie Spice:</strong> You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your <a target="_blank" href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/pumpkin-pie-spice/">own homemade pumpkin pie spice</a>. If you don’t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice. This is in addition to the 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon—you will still add that.<br>
     <br>
      <strong>Chilled Dough:</strong> If you are chilling the pumpkin cookie dough for longer than 30 minutes, the cookie dough will likely have to sit on the counter at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before scooping/rolling because it will be quite cold and solid. The amount of time it needs to sit at room temperature depends on how long the dough has chilled. If I chill my cookie dough for around 24 hours, I let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bigger Batch:</strong> Cookie recipe can easily be doubled by doubling each ingredient. Chill the cookie dough for 45 minutes.<br>

      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large bowl beat the eggs and pumpkin together.  In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves, and add to pumpkin mixture. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Gradually stir in the evaporated milk. Carefully pour mixture into unbaked pie shell*. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Bake at 425 degrees F for for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350° F; bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer, or until the pie is set. Check for doneness by giving the pie a gentle wiggle. The center may jiggle just a tiny bit. It will continue to set up as it cools. Or, it is done when a sharp knife inserted in center comes out clean.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Cool completely on a wire cooling rack. Serve immediately with whipped cream and caramel pecan topping, if desired. <br>

 <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p class="notes">
      <strong> Pie Pan:</strong> The filling works best for a 9x2inch pie pan. If using a smaller pan, you wont need all of the filling.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Make Ahead Instructions:</strong> You can make the entire pie the day before and store it the refrigerator, or prepare the pie crust and filling the day before and store them separately in the refrigerator until ready to bake the next day.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Storage Instrucytions:</strong> Store-bought pumpkin pies can sit at room temperature because of the preservatives added, but homemade pumpkin pie should be refrigerated if not eaten within 2 hours of sitting out.  Leftover pumpkin pie will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.  Be sure to allow pumpkin pie to cool completely and then cover it loosely with plastic wrap, for storing.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Freezing Instructions:</strong> Cooked pumpkin pie can be frozen for up to 3 months, covered well. You can also freeze the pie crust for up to 3 months. Thaw pumpkin pie overnight in the refrigerator before serving.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>How to avoid cracks your pumpkin pie:</strong> The most common reason for cracking on the top of a pumpkin pie is from over-baking. To avoid cracking, check the pie after the first 55 minutes and give it a soft shake, looking for the filling to be set (slightly soft on top but not overly jiggly). Remember it will continue to cook once you've taken it out! Also, don't rush the cooling process, which could also result in cracking. Allow it to cool completely, undisturbed, at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>How to tell when Pumpkin Pie is ready:</strong> The easiest way to test whether a pumpkin pie is ready, or fully cooked, is to gently jiggle the pan, using an oven mit. If the center is overly jiggly, then it needs more time. It's okay if the center jiggles very slightly, as it will continue to set up as it cools. Or, it is done when a sharp knife inserted in center comes out clean.

      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk and sugar to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Stir pumpkin puree, room temperature egg and melted butter, mixing until smooth and well combined and creamy. Next stir in bread flour, pumpkin pie spice and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Place dough hook on mixer and knead dough on low speed for 8-10 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. (If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.) <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Transfer dough ball to a large bowl greased with olive oil or nonstick cooking spray, then cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x16 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the sugar into the butter. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Tightly roll dough up the dough, starting from the 14-inch side (the smaller side) and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be. Then cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife. You should get 12 rolls. I like to make dents in the dough before cutting as demonstrated in the photos, to make 12 even rolls. <br>
       <br>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. I highly recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out. Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let the cinnamon rolls rise again for about 30 minutes, then preheat your oven. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to under bake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 10 minutes before frosting. Makes 12 cinnamon rolls <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong>To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer or in a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, maple syrup and salt. Beat until smooth. Spread over the pumpkin cinnamon rolls and serve! Sprinkle cinnamon rolls with a little cinnamon for a pretty look. Enjoy!

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p class="notes">
      <strong> To make vegan pumpkin cinnamon rolls: </strong> simply leave the egg out of the recipe and add 3-4 tablespoons more pumpkin puree to the dough. You’ll also need to make sure to use almond milk, vegan butter, and vegan cream cheese in the recipe.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Don’t overheat your milk:</strong> It should be between 105-115 degrees F. Anything hotter is likely to kill the yeast, which means the cinnamon rolls will not rise. A simple tip is to dip your finger in the milk — it should feel warm similar to warm bath water but not HOT. If you warmed it up too much, simply wait a few minutes until it cools down enough to touch.<br>

      <strong>Storage Instrucytions:</strong> Store-bought pumpkin pies can sit at room temperature because of the preservatives added, but homemade pumpkin pie should be refrigerated if not eaten within 2 hours of sitting out.  Leftover pumpkin pie will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.  Be sure to allow pumpkin pie to cool completely and then cover it loosely with plastic wrap, for storing.<br>

      <strong>Make sure to use room temperature butter for the filling:</strong> a lot of recipes call for using melted butter in the filling, but that will cause the filling to leak out before baking. Room temperature butter is best!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Rub the brown sugar into the butter:</strong> after you spread out the softened butter, it’s important to rub the brown sugar into the butter.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Use a room temperature egg in the dough:</strong> if you use a cold egg, there’s a chance it could affect the yeast or mix with the melted butter and cause it to coagulate.
      <strong>Use bread flour:</strong> bread flour is available at most grocery stores and it makes ALL the difference in achieving softer, fluffy pumpkin cinnamon rolls.
      <strong>Make sure you flour your work surface and the rolling pin:</strong> this is to prevent the cinnamon rolls from sticking the surface or to the rolling pin.
