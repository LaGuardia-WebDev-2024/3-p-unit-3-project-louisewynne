      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla and blotted pumpkin until smooth. Set aside. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft. Fold in 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Cover the dough and chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Chilling the dough is imperative for this recipe. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove dough from the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone   baking mats.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Scoop the dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and roll each into balls. Arrange cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Using the back of a spoon or the bottom of a cup/measuring cup, slightly flatten the tops of the dough balls. (Without doing so, the cookies may not spread.) <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set. The cookies will look very soft in the center. Remove from the oven. If you find that your cookies didn’t spread much at all, flatten them out with the back of a spoon when you take them out of the oven. If desired, press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is only for looks. <br>
       <br>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Cool cookies on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. The longer the cookies cool, the even better they taste! The flavor gets stronger and the texture becomes chewier. I usually let them sit, uncovered, for several hours before serving. Chewiness and pumpkin flavor are even stronger on day 2. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. <br>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p class="notes">
      <strong>Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:</strong> You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature, then continue with step 4. Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw.<br>
      <br>
     <strong>Pumpkin:</strong> Squeeze as much of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree as you can before adding it to the cookie dough. I simply squeeze the puree with paper towels. See photo in the post for a visual. This will help produce a less cakey cookie. Less moisture is a good thing here! Measure 6 Tablespoons AFTER the pumpkin has been squeezed/blotted. Do not use pumpkin pie filling.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>Pumpkin Pie Spice:</strong> You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your <a target="_blank" href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/pumpkin-pie-spice/">own homemade pumpkin pie spice</a>. If you don’t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice. This is in addition to the 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon—you will still add that.<br>
     <br>
      <strong>Chilled Dough:</strong> If you are chilling the pumpkin cookie dough for longer than 30 minutes, the cookie dough will likely have to sit on the counter at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before scooping/rolling because it will be quite cold and solid. The amount of time it needs to sit at room temperature depends on how long the dough has chilled. If I chill my cookie dough for around 24 hours, I let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Bigger Batch:</strong> Cookie recipe can easily be doubled by doubling each ingredient. Chill the cookie dough for 45 minutes.<br>

  <h2>Pumpkin Pie</h2>

      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large bowl beat the eggs and pumpkin together.  In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves, and add to pumpkin mixture. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Gradually stir in the evaporated milk. Carefully pour mixture into unbaked pie shell*. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Bake at 425 degrees F for for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350° F; bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer, or until the pie is set. Check for doneness by giving the pie a gentle wiggle. The center may jiggle just a tiny bit. It will continue to set up as it cools. Or, it is done when a sharp knife inserted in center comes out clean.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Cool completely on a wire cooling rack. Serve immediately with whipped cream and caramel pecan topping, if desired. <br>

 <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p class="notes">
      <strong> Pie Pan:</strong> The filling works best for a 9x2inch pie pan. If using a smaller pan, you wont need all of the filling.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Make Ahead Instructions:</strong> You can make the entire pie the day before and store it the refrigerator, or prepare the pie crust and filling the day before and store them separately in the refrigerator until ready to bake the next day.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Storage Instrucytions:</strong> Store-bought pumpkin pies can sit at room temperature because of the preservatives added, but homemade pumpkin pie should be refrigerated if not eaten within 2 hours of sitting out.  Leftover pumpkin pie will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.  Be sure to allow pumpkin pie to cool completely and then cover it loosely with plastic wrap, for storing.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Freezing Instructions:</strong> Cooked pumpkin pie can be frozen for up to 3 months, covered well. You can also freeze the pie crust for up to 3 months. Thaw pumpkin pie overnight in the refrigerator before serving.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>How to avoid cracks your pumpkin pie:</strong> The most common reason for cracking on the top of a pumpkin pie is from over-baking. To avoid cracking, check the pie after the first 55 minutes and give it a soft shake, looking for the filling to be set (slightly soft on top but not overly jiggly). Remember it will continue to cook once you've taken it out! Also, don't rush the cooling process, which could also result in cracking. Allow it to cool completely, undisturbed, at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>How to tell when Pumpkin Pie is ready:</strong> The easiest way to test whether a pumpkin pie is ready, or fully cooked, is to gently jiggle the pan, using an oven mit. If the center is overly jiggly, then it needs more time. It's okay if the center jiggles very slightly, as it will continue to set up as it cools. Or, it is done when a sharp knife inserted in center comes out clean.
